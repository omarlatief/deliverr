## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **external_product_id** | **String** | A permanent unique reference for this product generated by and meaningful to the API user. This value will be used when sending orders to identify the product to ship, when reporting products shipped, and when reporting inventory levels or updates. This value should be chosen to represent a PHYSICAL product in the external system, not a virtual product, bundle or kit, unless the bundle or kit is inbounded as a single barcoded product. This value must be unique among all products created via API. |  |
| **title** | **String** | The product title or short description. Should represent a single line of text suitable to identify the product or for search purposes. |  |
| **sku** | **String** | The human-readable Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) for reporting. This value may change over time. |  |

| **dims_locked** | **Boolean** | **true** if the dimensions and weight of the item are verified and trusted. Must be true for non-zero inventory levels to be reported. If true, item dimensions and weight can no longer be updated via the API. |  |
| **created_at** | **Time** | The timestamp of creation in RFC 3339 format. e.g. 2017-07-21T17:32:28Z |  |

Hazmat types can currently only be set in the web portal UI or through a support request and must go through a documentation approval process before hazmat categorized items can be inbounded or shipped. Currently only used for restricted battery type support. |  |
